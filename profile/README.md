# [Lita](https://www.lita.foundation/)

Lita is building Valida, the fastest zkVM, optimized from the ground up for zero-knowledge proofs with a custom instruction set. Valida delivers an average 50x latency improvement and 100x cost savings over alternative solutions in real-world applications (see [Lita benchmarks](https://lita.gitbook.io/lita-documentation/architecture/benchmarks) and [third party benchmarks](https://vac.dev/rlog/zkVM-testing/)).

Supporting high-level languages such as Rust and C, and with plans to integrate with Go, WASM and others, developers can leverage familiar tools for provable and trustless applications.
