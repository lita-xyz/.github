Lita is building and maintaining Valida zk-VM and its toolchain for succinct and zero-knowledge proving, leading in speed, efficiency, developer productivity, and modularity.

With speeds surpassing existing systems, in some cases by 10-100x, Lita accelerates zero-knowledge proving to unprecedented levels. Supporting high-level languages like Rust and C, and with plans to integrate with Go, WASM and others, developers can leverage familiar tools for provable and trustless applications.
